Hello, I'm @azank-hyder.

I have a keen interest in web3 and blockchain technology. Currently, I'm immersed in learning smart contract engineering using Solidity for Ethereum and Web3.js.

I'm actively seeking collaboration opportunities on projects, particularly those involving smart contracts and Dapp development.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at azanhyder49@gmail.com. I'm excited about the possibilities in the blockchain space and eager to contribute to innovative projects.
